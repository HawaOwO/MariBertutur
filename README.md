# MariBertutur – Malay Phonics System

## Abstract
For toddlers and young children who want to play more than learn, serious learning might be challenging. It can be tough for parents to help their children who have trouble speaking and reading properly especially those who didn’t want to learn, which is why this project was developed. The purpose of this project is to develop an interesting tool that will attract kids, which is a mobile application that parents, and other adults may use to help their kids learn to read and speak words correctly until they are fluent in the language. The effort was solely concerned with Malay phonics in order to aid both Malay speakers and non-Malay speakers in learning this language correctly and easily. This mobile app offers puzzle games, spelling, and pronunciation lessons for words and the alphabet. The project's goal is to assist toddlers and young children speak more clearly, enjoy learning with our mobile app, and be able to read better.
